## **Slide 6: Data Flow**

**Data Flow Diagram**:
```
Document Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embedding Generation → Vector Storage
                                                                    ↓
User Query → Semantic Search → Context Assembly → LLM Processing → Response
```

**Data Flow of your solution**:

1. **Document Ingestion Flow**:
   - Document uploaded via API endpoint
   - Document processor extracts text based on file type
   - Text is split into manageable clauses (sentences/paragraphs)
   - Each clause is converted to vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers
   - Embeddings stored in FAISS index with metadata in SQLite
   - Document metadata stored for future reference

2. **Query Processing Flow**:
   - User submits natural language question
   - Query is converted to embedding using same model
   - FAISS performs semantic search to find most similar clauses
   - Top 3 most relevant clauses are assembled as context
   - Context and query sent to LLM for answer generation
   - Response is cached and returned to user

3. **Data Storage Flow**:
   - Document metadata: SQLite database
   - Clause embeddings: FAISS vector index
   - Clause metadata: JSON file with vector IDs
   - Query logs: SQLite with timestamps and responses
   - LLM responses: JSON cache file
